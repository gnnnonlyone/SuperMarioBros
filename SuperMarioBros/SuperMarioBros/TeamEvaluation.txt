This time we didn't use much of the azure tasks so the burn down chart is not very useful.
	The group spent the decent amount of time on Sprint 6. The thing we still
	need to work on is cooperation, communication and time management. Although we 
	spend a lot of time on Sprint 6, there are still some place that we don't satisfy about 
	it but we lack of time. The team reflected and talked about a possible solution is start
	to divide and assign the different parts of the project earlier so we can start earlier.
	What's more, cooperation and communication is also important. If we didn't figure out a 
	solution for our own aasignment for 1 days, we should ask others in the team for help and 
	we can work it together. If someone in the group ask for help, we should help him after we
	finished our own part. We should save at least one day before due for overall checking and
	revising.
