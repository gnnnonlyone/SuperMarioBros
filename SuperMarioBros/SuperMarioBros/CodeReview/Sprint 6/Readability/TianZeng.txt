        public SwimFishPhysics(Vector2 position)
        {
            Position = position;
            Velocity = Constant.Constant.Instance.SwimFishSpeed;
            // Acceleration = new Vector2(0,10);
            Gravity = true;
            OutOfBoundary = false;
            InCollision = false;
            Steering = false;
            Walk();
        }
	    public void Walk()
        {
          
        }

Commands on code quality:
Overall, the code is clean, the readability is good, naming is meaningful, I can easily 
understand the purpose of the most of codes. However, this segment of code would be a little 
confused. The constructor of SwimFishPhysics will can Walk(), but Walk() has no any implementation, 
so I'm wondering if this method is necessary, or it need to updata in the future.
