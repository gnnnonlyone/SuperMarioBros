Commands on code quality:
	Overall, you produce high quality code. I am just going to point out one place that causes a little difficulty to read. That is in your
CheckBoundary method, you use a really long sentence to make the if condition. I would say a lot of people would be confused by that. I would recomment that 
you put the condition into one variable and check that variable instead. Also don't forget to fully express what the variable is for.
