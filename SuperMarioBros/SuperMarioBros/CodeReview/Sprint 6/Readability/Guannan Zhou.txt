            if (!InCollision)
            {
               // Velocity = new Vector2(-1 * Velocity.X, Velocity.Y);
                Steering = true;
            }
        }

        public void Walk()
        {
           // Acceleration = new Vector2(0, Acceleration.Y);
           // Velocity = new Vector2(30, 30);

        }

Comments:
I feel like this method should be renamed as "Swim" since the fish cannot walk. Furhtermore,
the name of "ChangeDirection" is not descriptive here. 
We might want to keep these methods since it is inherited from IEnemyPhysics. So, the problem 
is, if it is necesseray to create a new interface called 'IFishPhysics'.
