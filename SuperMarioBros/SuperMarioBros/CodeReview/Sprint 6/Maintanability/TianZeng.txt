Commands on code quality:
Overall, the code is very clear, cohesion is high and the coupling is low. But I think the realization 
of gravity still needs to be improved. Because the gravity of jellyfish should be the same as ordinary 
gravity, the underwater world is slower because of buoyancy. Therefore, the most perfect situation should 
be the introduction of buoyancy. This may have a small impact on maintainability, but it does not cause 
any major problems. In short, the code is very maintainable.
