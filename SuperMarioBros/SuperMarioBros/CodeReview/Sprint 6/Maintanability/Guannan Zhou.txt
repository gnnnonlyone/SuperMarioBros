Overall, those two classes work well in the sprint. It's a good idea to create new classes 
for future maintenable consideration.
However, those two classes are not "cheap" classes in the project. "SwimMario" is nearly
200 lines.

Most parts of the SwimMario.cs is similar to the Mario.cs. The major difference
is that we want to change the sprite of Mario. In this case, we can add a MarioState
called swimstate to handle it. 
If we do need a new class, abstract the common parts of the code.

For SwimMarioPhysics, the problem is that we need to change the "velocity" some methods.
Would prefer use a bool variable "isSwim" instead of creating a new physics class.
