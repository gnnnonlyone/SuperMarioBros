Comments on code quality:
For all the physics classes, we have common parts of it, such as the velocity,
the position, and the update method looks same. I'm thinking if we could use the strategy
pattern or template method pattern to construct our physics classes. We could separate
the fundamental structure from the program, which will reduce lines of code and make our code
more resilient to changes.
