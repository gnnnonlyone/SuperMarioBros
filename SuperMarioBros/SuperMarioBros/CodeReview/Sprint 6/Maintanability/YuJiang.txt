Commands on code quality:
	Overall speaking, the class is of good quality. But I do notice one thing, the class is trying to do a lot of things at one time. I can see that 
you are putting all the things related to jelly fish together. I would say this is increasing couplping, which makes the code hard to maintain. I would 
suggest that you can put some of the functionality within the enemy physics class and dedicate this class to only taking care of the jelly fish's state.
In this way, I mean, slitting up all the functionality, would allow better maintainability. I would also recommend that you go along with other enemy class 
that we wrote, trying to keep the style all together.
