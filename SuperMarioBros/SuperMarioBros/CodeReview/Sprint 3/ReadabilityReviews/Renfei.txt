specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The first thing I noticed is the Block 2D array. I'm not sure what is 
the purpose of making a 2D array of the Blocks, but I think at least for
Sprint 3, it is sufficient to store blocks in a 1D array. The 2d array makes
the code hard to read at many places, such as multiple nested for loops and
the way we get and set the value of a block.
For future refactoring, I'm thinking to change the 2D array Block to a list of 
array of block, so it will easy to write, maintain and read the code.
