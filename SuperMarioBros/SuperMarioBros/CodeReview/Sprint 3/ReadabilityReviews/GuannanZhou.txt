 private BlockBeveledState stateMachine;
        
        public string blockName { get; set; }
        public Vector2 SpriteLocation { get; set; }
        

        public BeveledBlock(Vector2 position, string name)
        {
            stateMachine = new BlockBeveledState();
            SpriteLocation = position;
            blockName = name;
        }

Overall, the readability of the code is pretty good. The name of the variable
matches its function. The name of the class is clear. However, the string variable "name" 
in the constructor may casue confusion. It's hard for user to find the right input 
of the variable "name". Also, the variable "SpriteLocation" may need to rename in the 
future, cause in other item classes, we have variable like "Location" and "ItemLocation".
Actually, they are both used to illustrate the position of the game object.
