Specific comments on code quality: 
In the method HandleCollision, there is a huge if-elseif block to differentiate
different kind of blocks and call different collision method. To me, this class 
is doing too many things.
A hypothetical change: 
I am thinking if we can spilit this class into separate small classes to handle 
different kinds of block collision with mario.
