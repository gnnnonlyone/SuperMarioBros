Specific comments on code quality:
This document works for correctly detecting collision between Mario and items, Mario and blocks, Mario and enemy.
Specifically, there's a method that is supposed to detect Mario's collision with blocks. This time, the group has 
spent a significant amount of time to work on its successful dection with the ground block, which contains a lot of 
time to debug because the way it's written. I would suggest that, instead of using a lot of parameters and variables
to store the index of the block, you could use some more specific names, makingit more easy to maintain. Also, writing
comments is very important to help with the whole debuging process.
