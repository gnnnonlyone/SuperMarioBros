        public void TakeDamage()
        {
            if (MarioPowerUpState is MarioSmallState)
            {
                MarioAnimatedState = new MarioDeadState();
            }
            else
            {
                MarioPowerUpState = new MarioSmallState();
            }
        }

Comments: The MarioPowerUpState may cause confution here. Considered change it 
to bool properties in the future sprints.

        public IMarioAnimatedState MarioAnimatedState { get; set; }
        public IMarioPowerUpState MarioPowerUpState { get; set; }
        public Vector2 Location { get; set; }

        private readonly double delay = 0.1d;
        private double time;
        private bool action;

Comments: To the meantainability consideration, we should consider put these readonly 
variables in a seperate file in the future design.

        public void Down()
        {
            if (action)
            {
                MarioAnimatedState.Down();
            }
        }

Comments: Should consider move this Down, Left, Right, Up operations into Command classes.
As the Mario class, it shouldn't show all posible operations.
