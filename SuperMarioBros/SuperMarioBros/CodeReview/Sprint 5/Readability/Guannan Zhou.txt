        public void Win()
        {
            ScoreObj.Won = true;
        }


Comments: I felt confused on this method at first. Actually, the purpose
of the method is to told the Headup Line that the player is win. The actual
logic of Win state transaction will be handled in the main class. Would consider
change the name of the method or remove the method.

       public void Pause()
        {
            if (canSetPause)
            {
                Paused = !Paused;
                SoundFactory.Instance.CreatePauseSound();
            }
            canSetPause = false;
        }

Comments: Actually, this method combines Pasue and Resume together. I would
consier use two seperate methods.
