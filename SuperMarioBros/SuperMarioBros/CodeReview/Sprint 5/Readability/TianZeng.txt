                if (side == CollisionSide.Top && enemy.Collidable)
                {
                    enemy.BeStomped();
                    SoundFactory.Instance.CreateStompSound();
                    TreeNewBee.SuperMarioBros.Instance.WorldStateManager.Score += Constant.Instance.HitGoombaReward;
                }

Comments: The name "BeStomped" should be changed, since it shouldn't be considered
as a descriptive variable name. Also, the responsibilities of MarioGoombaCollision 
and MarioKoopaCollision are similar. Consider combine together in the future.
