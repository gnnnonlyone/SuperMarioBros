	I notice that you are putting all the state management in this file, which is a good thing. But I also see that for the remaining life
stuff, it's still implementing in the Mario class. I would suggest that you put all the state in this file, which should include checking if the 
remaining life of mario is 0. If it is, it should then call the lose function that you wrote and go ahead to display the gameover message.
Overall, other part looks good and is of good readability.
