                SuperMarioBros.Instance.ScManager.RemainingLife -= Constant.Instance.OneRemainingLife;
                SuperMarioBros.Instance.Manager.SetDelay();
                if (SuperMarioBros.Instance.ScManager.RemainingLife <= Constant.Instance.NoRemainingLife)
                {

                    SuperMarioBros.Instance.Manager.LostGame();
                    SoundFactory.Instance.CreateGameOverSound();
                }

            }
        }

		This method has nested branches and being check every time the update being called, which is very resource and 
		time consuming. We can change it into another state and update the state only.
