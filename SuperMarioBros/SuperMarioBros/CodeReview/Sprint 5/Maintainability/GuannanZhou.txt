Comments: 
The purpose of the function is to remove most of the command in the keyboardcontroller. Currently,
we want to remove all commands other than the resume command. Thus, it's a good idea to change the 
structure of the function. For instance, add a paramter ICommand represents the only command that 
we want to keep.
Also, consider using a dictionary to make the function simple.
