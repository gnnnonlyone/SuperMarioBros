Overall the score class is of good quality. I would say one suggestion would be the score should be consistent. In other world, if Mario gets in
to a new world, he should not be assigned a new score. I would suggest that instead of creating a new score for Mario every time, you should set it 
as a property and allow the score to be extracted. Every time we are updating the old score instead of creating a new one.
