	The class is in control of the physics state of mario, i.e. running. The main function is to let mario running when the user hits the right or left
	arrow button, and also run faster when the same button is hit twice. The file has a problem with the acceleration of mario. I would suggest that you 
	use a different approach to deal with the acceleration. Instead of creating a new Vector and add it to the velocity, you can use a constance as the 
	acceleration speed for mario, so that it doesn't get updated every time and be set to 0 which is the starting velocity.
