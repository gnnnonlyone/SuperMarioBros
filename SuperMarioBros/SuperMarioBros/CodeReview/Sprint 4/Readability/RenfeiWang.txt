Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
The methods are designed reasonable and the names are readable.
For methods that deal with detecting collision without block, they
are pretty readable. However, for methods that deal with detectinf collision
with blocks, they are not that readable since the data structure we decided to
use for the blocks. I think we may need to change it during the refactor.
What's more, every detection methods looks very similar in this class and I'm thinking
if we could reduce the number of methods here.
