Commands on code quality:
	I would say overall the code looks really good. One thing to point out is the code uses a lot of constance variable. In other word,
	It's not good for maintaining the codes. I would say just take out the constance variables. And put a regular variable there I would say. 
	Then every time initialise them in the method and also change their values in other file through calling them. It might take some time but
	it's easier to maintain.
