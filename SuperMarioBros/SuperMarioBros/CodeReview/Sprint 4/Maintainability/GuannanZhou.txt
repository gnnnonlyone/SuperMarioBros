Commands on code quality

 private SuperMarioBros game;
        public KeyboardController(SuperMarioBros game)
        {
            this.game = game;
            keyboardControllerMap = new Dictionary<Keys, ICommand>();
        }

Comments: Ideally, the controller shouldn't know the exsistence of the
game.

 public void Update()
        {
            KeyboardState keyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();
            foreach (KeyValuePair<Keys, ICommand> keyboardControllerMapPair in keyboardControllerMap)
            {
                if (keyboardState.IsKeyDown(keyboardControllerMapPair.Key))
                {
                    keyboardControllerMapPair.Value.Execute();
                }
                if (keyboardState.IsKeyUp(Keys.Left) && keyboardState.IsKeyUp(Keys.A) && keyboardState.IsKeyUp(Keys.Right) && keyboardState.IsKeyUp(Keys.D))
                {
                    foreach (KeyValuePair<Keys, ICommand> keyboarMapPair in keyboardControllerMap)
                    {
                        if(keyboarMapPair.Key==Keys.M)
                        {
                            keyboarMapPair.Value.Execute();
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

Comments: Update method shouldn't have such a complicated statement, which will reduce the effectiveness of 
the code. Also, some hard code included in the if statement.
