Comment: Overall speaking, the codes are very simple structure with clear readability. 
One possible  suggestion will be the code could be more compact with adding one additional list to the main game class.
For example, now the method is to separately call three individual functions to create items, enemies, and blocks. 
I am suggesting we could use one function as a wrap up to call the functions to create marios, items, enemies, and blocks, 
which will make the code more concise and compact. 
The other thing is, within the CreateItem class, the “Vector2” is used as parameter to pass in to the functions. 
I feel like commenting should be a good approach to help explain what does each parameter mean.
