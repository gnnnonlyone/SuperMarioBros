Actually, "Jump" and "Up" are describing the same state of Mario. Should consider use one of these two words in the future
design.

Comments: I felt like "MarioAppearanceState" and "MarioAnimatedState" may cause confusion. It takes me some time to understand
the difference between them. Although these two variables looks pretty similar, their appearance may varies. "MarioAppearanceState"
is an enum variable while "MarioAnimatedState" is a state variable which is associated with state class.

        public ISprite CreateBeveledBlock(Vector2 position)
        {
            return new StaticSprite(beveledBlockSheet, new Rectangle(0, 0, beveledBlockSheet.Width, beveledBlockSheet.Height), position);
        }

        public ISprite CreateBrickBlock(Vector2 position)
        {
            return new StaticSprite(brickBlockSheet, new Rectangle(0, 0, brickBlockSheet.Width, brickBlockSheet.Height), position);
        }

        public ISprite CreateBrickBlock(Vector2 position)
        {
            return new StaticSprite(brokenBlockSheet, new Rectangle(0, 0, brokenBlockSheet.Width, brokenBlockSheet.Height), position);
        }

Comments: These three "StaticSprite" may cause confusion, since these three blocks are not the same object. May consider add "BeveledBlockSprite"
"BrickBlockSprite" and "BrickBlockSprite" in the future.
