	Overall the reset command works perfectly. There is one thing that I think you can consider changing. 
I see the file has only two function, which is the constructor and the Execute() function. Your way of 
initializing new Mario, new items, and new block as well as registering all the commands inside the 
Execute() function will work without a doubt. But if there’s anything you want to change about the 
command, you have to go back to this function to check line by line to change the things that you 
want to change. I think it’s the high coupling that we have discussed in class. Also, it’s not easy 
to maintain if there’re more things to add in later implementation. 
	One possible solution I can think of is, you can write three new functions that each construct a particular 
thing, like Mario, items, blocks, etc. Also, you can implement a new function like what you did in the 
main game file, -- using an addCommand() function to register the keys with the commands. 
	The advantage is obvious. You can easily find out which function is not working correctly with this 
implementation. Also, it’s low coupling, which means if anything is not working correctly, there’s 
a chance that the game won’t collapse. Also, it’s easy to maintain because you can easily change any
of the functions without intervening other functions.
