Sprint Number: Sprint 2
Name of the .cs file: SuperMarioBros.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Everyone in the team
Specific comments on code quality:
There are a lot of hard-coded stuff in this class such as the specific position.
I believe these hard-coded stuff should be changed in the following sprints since
it's not just simply displaying sprites on the screen. In that case, most of this
class should be rewritten.
A hypothetical change:
We may have another class to control what to display and we added the construction of 
the sprites inside that class, like building a world. When we need to do some change, we
only need to change the code in the world without changing the SuperMarioBros.cs class.
